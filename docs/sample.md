# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** Director, Strategic Psychological Operations
**FROM:** Lt. Commander H.E. Simons, Task Force Kerrigan
**DATE:** 30 May 2011
**SUBJECT:** *Phase I Report – Kerrigan Initiative (KI-45/A)*

Phase I of the Kerrigan Initiative concluded this month with the secure recall of all distributed literacy kits.  Operational logs—maintained under enclosure J-17—indicate that the subproject codenamed "Phonic Shadow" effected a measurable uptick in baseline compliance metrics among juvenile subjects.  Exact figures remain compartmented, but post-deployment debriefs note episodic recitations of budgetary line items during non-testing intervals, suggesting deeper mnemonic imprinting than originally forecast.

Admiral Maximillian Kerrigan's foundational directive (NSC-1986-022) envisioned a multilayered approach to cognitive conditioning, embedding low-frequency audio vectors within civilian media channels.  His private annotations—exhumed from Vault J-11—reference experimental "sonic exciter arrays" and glyph-encoded triggers intended to synchronize subject recall with predetermined node IDs.  Though these passages are heavily redacted ([REDACTED: FURTHER SOPHOS]), they imply future incorporation of digital interface modules under the projected codename "Mnemolock."

Field feedback remains mixed.  Several district education boards lodged informal inquiries after overhearing test-subjects chanting "Take No Prisoners" at spelling bees.  Whether this reflects deliberate psychological side-effects or an operator error in compliance-tone calibration is under review.  Anomalous flash-card glyphs—whose shape deviations mirror satellite uplink schematics—have prompted an NSA acoustics audit to rule out unintended cross-spectrum bleed-through.

All physical assets have been transferred to the "Curriculum Modernization Initiative" for incineration under cover protocols.  Remaining data, including Phase I audio masters and field memoranda, are slated for archival in enclosure KE-2025-0034.  Preparations for Phase II—focused on controlled trials of digital phonics applications—are pending NSC authorization.
